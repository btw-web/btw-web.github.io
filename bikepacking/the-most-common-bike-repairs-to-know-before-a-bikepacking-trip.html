<article><h1>The Most Common Bike Repairs to Know Before a Bikepacking Trip</h1>
<p>Bikepacking is a fun and adventurous way to explore the world on two wheels. However, there are certain precautions that every bikepacker should take before heading out on their trip. One of the most important things to prepare for is mechanical issues along the way.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most common bike repairs to know before a bikepacking trip:</p>
<h2>Flat Tires</h2>
<p>Flat tires are the most common mechanical issue that all cyclists face. It is essential to carry a patch kit, spare tubes, and a pump. As it is impossible to avoid flat tires altogether, it is important to know how to change them.</p>
<h2>Broken Chains</h2>
<p>A broken chain can bring your bike to a halt, and this can be a huge problem, especially if you’re in the middle of nowhere. It's important to have a chain tool and spare quick links that allow you to repair a broken chain quickly.</p>
<h2>Shifting Problems</h2>
<p>Bike gears can become misaligned, making it difficult to shift between gears. Misaligned gears are usually due to a bent derailleur hanger, and it is essential to carry a spare hanger to fix this problem. Additionally, it’s crucial to know how to adjust gears correctly in case of misalignment.</p>
<h2>Brake Issues</h2>
<p>Brakes are essential for safety when traveling at high speeds, especially if you’re riding in mountainous terrain. Disc brakes are more common in bikepacking, but brake pads can wear out. Make sure to carry replacement brake pads with you, and know how to replace them in case of wear or damage.</p>
<h2>Loose Bolts</h2>
<p>Loose bolts can lead to accidents, and it's important to check all bolts thoroughly before embarking on a trip. Carry a multi-tool with you that includes a range of wrenches, as well as a torque wrench to ensure that bolts are tightened to the correct torque values.</p>
<p>By preparing for these common bike repairs, you can have a stress-free bikepacking trip. Packing the right tools and having knowledge of how to perform these repairs can help you get back on the road and not let any mechanical issues ruin your adventure.</p></article><hr />
