<article><h1>Campsite Lighting Options: Lanterns, Headlamps, and Flashlights</h1>
<p>When it comes to camping, having the right lighting is essential for a successful trip. Whether you're preparing dinner, reading a book, or using the restroom, you need to be able to see what you're doing. In this article, we'll explore the three most popular lighting options for campsites: lanterns, headlamps, and flashlights.</p>
<h2>Lanterns</h2>
<p>Lanterns are a popular choice for lighting up campsites. They provide 360-degree illumination and can be placed on a table or hanging from a hook. There are different types of lanterns, including fuel-powered and battery-powered options. Fuel-powered lanterns use propane or white gas to create a bright light that can last for hours. Battery-powered lanterns, on the other hand, use LED lights and are generally less bright but more portable and easier to use.</p>
