<article><h1>Water Filtration and Purification Systems for Bikepacking</h1>
<p>Bikepacking is a unique way to explore the great outdoors. With all of your gear packed onto your bike, you can escape into nature and explore remote areas that you wouldn't be able to on foot. However, when you're on a multi-day bikepacking trip, it's important to have a reliable source of water. </p>
<h2>Types of Water Sources</h2>
<p>When bikepacking, you'll encounter a variety of water sources. These can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streams and rivers</li>
<li>Ponds and lakes</li>
<li>Natural springs</li>
<li>Man-made water sources like faucets and water fountains</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to note that not all water sources are safe to drink from. Even streams and rivers can contain harmful bacteria and parasites. </p>
<h2>Water Filtration Systems</h2>
<p>Water filtration systems are a popular choice among bikepackers. These systems use a physical barrier like a ceramic or carbon filter to remove impurities from water, making it safe to drink. </p>
<p>One popular water filter for bikepacking is the Sawyer Squeeze. This filter is small, lightweight, and attaches directly to a water bottle or hydration bladder. It has a .1 micron filter that removes 99.9% of all bacteria, protozoa, and other contaminants. </p>
<p>Another popular filtration system is the Katadyn BeFree. This system uses a collapsible soft bottle that filters water as you drink. The filter removes bacteria, cysts, and sediments, and has a flow rate of up to 2 liters per minute. </p>
<h2>Water Purification Systems</h2>
<p>Water purification systems use chemicals like iodine or chlorine to kill harmful bacteria and parasites in water. These systems are more effective than filters at killing viruses, but can leave an unpleasant taste in the water. </p>
<p>One purification system that's popular among bikepackers is AquaMira drops. These drops use chlorine dioxide to kill bacteria, viruses, and parasites, and come in a lightweight, easy-to-use dropper bottle. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When you're out on a multi-day bikepacking trip, it's important to have a reliable water source. Water filtration and purification systems are a great way to ensure that you have access to safe, drinkable water no matter where you are. Whether you choose a filter or a purification system, make sure to do your research and choose a system that works best for your needs. Stay hydrated and happy trails!</p></article><hr />
