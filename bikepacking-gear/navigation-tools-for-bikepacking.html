<article><h1>Navigation Tools for Bikepacking</h1>
<p>Bikepacking, the adventurous blend of cycling and backpacking, has increasingly become popular among cyclists. It requires endurance, physical fitness, and outdoor skills.

<h2>Top Navigation Tools for Bikepacking</h2>
<h3>1. GPS Devices</h3>
<p>One of the popular navigation tools among bikepackers are GPS devices. They have become more prevalent in recent years and come in various forms.

<h3>5. Compass</h3>
<p>A compass is a valuable navigation tool for bikepackers. It's an essential tool for those venturing into unfamiliar territories with no marked trails. A compass can be used as a backup navigation tool in case you lose access to technology-based ones.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Navigation is a crucial aspect of bikepacking, and having the right tools can make all the difference. In this article, we have highlighted the top navigation tools that bikepackers use, including GPS devices, smartphone apps, paper maps, bike computers, and compasses.
