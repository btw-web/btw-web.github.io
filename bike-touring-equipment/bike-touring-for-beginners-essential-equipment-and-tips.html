Ensure your bike is properly maintained, and your tyres are inflated to the correct pressure.</p>
<h3>Panniers</h3>
<p>Panniers are a type of bike bags that attach to the bike's rear rack. They come in pairs, and you can use them to carry all your gear. Panniers come in various sizes, and you can choose depending on how much gear you need to carry. Ensure the load in each pannier is balanced to help maintain stable balance when cycling.</p>
<h3>Repair Kit</h3>
<p>It's essential to bring a repair kit to fix any punctures or other bike issues. Bring a spare inner tube, a multi-tool, tyre levers, a pump, and a patch kit.</p>
<h3>Food and Water</h3>
