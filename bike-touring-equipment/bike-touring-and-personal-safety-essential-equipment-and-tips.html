<h2>Essential Equipment</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Helmet: No matter how experienced of a cyclist you are, a helmet is a must when cycling. A properly fitting helmet can save your life in case of an accident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lights: It is important to have lights on the front and back of your bicycle. This helps increase visibility, especially when cycling in low-light conditions or at night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lock: When touring, you will need to leave your bike unattended at times. A sturdy lock will help prevent theft and keep your bike secure.</p>

<p>First Aid Kit: Accidents can happen anytime, anywhere. A first aid kit can come in handy when dealing with minor scrapes or injuries.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Basic Safety Tips</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Plan Your Route: Before heading out on your tour, research the area and plan your route. Choose routes with bike lanes or low traffic that will make for a safer cycling experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be Visible: Wear bright or reflective clothing and use the lights on your bike to make yourself more visible to motorists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow Traffic Laws: Just like a car, a bicycle is subject to traffic laws. Obey traffic signals, stop signs, and speed limits to ensure your own safety as well as others'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stay Alert: Keep an eye out for unexpected obstacles or hazards such as potholes or loose gravel. Also, stay aware of your surroundings by not wearing headphones or other distractions while riding.</p>
